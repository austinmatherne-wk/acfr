	Its the amount after accumulated depreciation and amortization of physical assets such as land, improvements to land, easements, buildings, building improvements, vehicles, machinery, equipment, works of art and historical treasures, infrastructure, construction in progress, and all other tangible or intangible assets that have been or will be used in operations and that have initial useful lives extending beyond a single reporting period. Infrastructure assets are long-lived capital assets that normally are stationary in nature and normally can be preserved for a significantly greater number of years than most capital assets. 
		
Capital assets also includes intangible asset. Intangible asset [GASB 25] possesses all of the following characteristics:
a.  Lack of physical substance. An asset may be contained in or on an item with physical substance, for example, a compact disc in the case of computer software. An asset also may be closely associated with another item that has physical substance, for example, the underlying land in the case of a right-of-way easement. These modes of containment and associated items should not be considered when determining whether or not an asset lacks physical substance.

b.  Non-financial nature. In the context of this section, an asset with a non-financial nature is one that is not in a monetary form similar to cash and investment securities, and it represents neither a claim or right to assets in a monetary form similar to receivables, nor a prepayment for goods or services.

c.  Initial useful life extending beyond a single reporting period.</link:label>

The financial reporting entity consists of the primary government and organizations for which the primary government is financially accountable. In addition, the primary government may determine through the exercise of management's professional judgment that the inclusion of an organization that does not meet the financial accountability criteria is necessary in order to prevent the reporting entity's financial statements from being misleading. In such circumstances, that organization should be included as a component unit. The nucleus of a financial reporting entity usually is a primary government. However, a governmental organization other than a primary government (such as a component unit, a joint venture, a jointly governed organization, or an other stand-alone government) serves as the nucleus for its own reporting entity when it issues separate financial reports. Although this section is written from the perspective of the primary government, its requirements apply to the separately issued basic financial statements of governmental component units, joint ventures, jointly governed organizations, and other stand-alone governments. These organizations should apply the provisions of this section as if they were a primary government.</link:label>

A long-lived asset shall be classified as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: 
 a. Management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset. 
 b. The asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets 
 c. An active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset have been initiated. 
 d. The sale of the asset is probable within one year. 
 e. The asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. The price at which a long-lived asset is being marketed is indicative of whether the entity currently has the intent and ability to sell the asset. A market price that is reasonable in relation to fair value indicates that the asset is available for immediate sale, whereas a market price in excess of fair value indicates that the asset is not available for immediate sale. 
 f. Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn</link:label>

1. The term capital assets includes land, improvements to land, easements, buildings, building improvements, vehicles, machinery, equipment, works of art and historical treasures, infrastructure, and all other tangible or intangible assets that are used in operations
2. That have initial useful lives extending beyond a single reporting period. 
3. Infrastructure assets are long-lived capital assets that normally are stationary in nature and normally can be preserved for a significantly greater number of years than most capital assets. Examples of infrastructure assets include roads, bridges, tunnels, drainage systems, water and sewer systems, dams, and lighting systems. Buildings, except those that are an ancillary part of a network of infrastructure assets, should not be considered infrastructure assets for purposes of this section.

The term capital assets also includes intangible asset
Intangible asset [GASB 25] possesses all of the following characteristics:

a.  Lack of physical substance. An asset may be contained in or on an item with physical substance, for example, a compact disc in the case of computer software. An asset also may be closely associated with another item that has physical substance, for example, the underlying land in the case of a right-of-way easement. These modes of containment and associated items should not be considered when determining whether or not an asset lacks physical substance.

b.  Non-financial nature. In the context of this section, an asset with a non-financial nature is one that is not in a monetary form similar to cash and investment securities, and it represents neither a claim or right to assets in a monetary form similar to receivables, nor a prepayment for goods or services.

c.  Initial useful life extending beyond a single reporting period.</link:label>

Governments should report governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary funds to the extent that they have activities that meet the criteria for using those funds. a. Governmental fund reporting focuses primarily on the sources, uses, and balances of current financial resources and often has a budgetary orientation. The governmental fund category includes the general fund, special revenue funds, capital projects funds, debt service funds, and permanent funds. Governmental funds are, in essence, accounting segregations of financial resources. Expendable assets are assigned to the various governmental funds according to the purposes for which they may or must be used; current liabilities are assigned to the fund from which they are to be paid; and the difference between governmental fund assets and deferred outflows of resources, and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, the fund equity, is referred to as "Fund Balance."</link:label>

Activities of the government which resemble private-sector business activities not only because they provide the same services as private-sector businesses but also because there is an exchange relationship between the provider and the consumer: The consumer is charged for services rendered. Some bear a further resemblance to private-sector business activities because they are self-sufficient and operate as separate, legally constituted organizations. Others more closely resemble governmental-type activities because they are regularly subsidized by taxes or are operated as departments within a government.</link:label>

	1. A primary government is any state government or general purpose local government (municipality or county) as well as a special-purpose government (for example, a school district or a park district). 
	2. The foundation of a primary government is a separately elected governing body—one that is elected by the citizens in a general, popular election. As the nucleus of the financial reporting entity, the primary government generally is the focal point for the users of the financial statements. Thus, it is important to define the primary government and determine what it comprises. A primary government is any state government or general purpose local government (municipality or county). A primary government is also a special-purpose government (for example, a school district or a park district) that meets all of the following criteria:
 
 a. It has a separately elected governing body.
 
 b. It is legally separate
 
 c. It is fiscally independent
 
 3. A primary government consists of all the organizations that make up its legal entity. All funds, organizations, institutions, Entities, departments, and offices that are not legally separate are, for financial reporting purposes, part of a primary government. If an organization is part of a primary government, its financial data should be included with the financial data of the primary government.</link:label>

Charges for services is the term used for a broad category of program revenues that arise from charges to customers, applicants, or others who purchase, use, or directly benefit from the goods, services, or privileges provided, or are otherwise directly affected by the services. Revenues in this category include fees charged for specific services, such as water use or garbage collection; licenses and permits, such as dog licenses, liquor licenses, and building permits; operating special assessments, such as for street cleaning or special street lighting; and any other amounts charged to service recipients. Fines and forfeitures are also included in this category because they result from direct charges to those who are otherwise directly affected by a program or service, even though they receive no benefit. Payments from other governments for goods or services—for example, when County A reimburses County B for boarding County A's prisoners—also should be reported in this category.</link:label>

Program revenues are amounts which are derived directly from the program itself or from parties outside the reporting government's taxpayers or citizenry, as a whole; they reduce the net cost of the function to be financed from the government's general revenues. The statement of activities should separately report three categories 16 of program revenues: (a) charges for services, (b) program-specific operating grants and contributions, and (c) program-specific capital grants and contributions. For identifying the function to which a program revenue pertains, the determining factor for charges for services is which function generates 17 the revenue. For grants and contributions, the determining factor is the function to which the revenues are restricted.</link:label>

The operations of the reporting government should be presented in a format that reports the net (expense) revenue of its individual functions. Net (expense) revenue is sometimes referred to as the "net cost" of a function or program and represents the total expenses of the function or program less its program revenues—that is, charges or fees and fines that derive directly from the function or program and grants and contributions that are restricted to the function or program. An objective of using the net (expense) revenue format is to report the relative financial burden of each of the reporting government's functions on its taxpayers. This format identifies the extent to which each function of the government draws from the general revenues of the government or is self-financing through fees and intergovernmental aid. This notion of burden on the reporting government's taxpayers is important in determining what is program or general revenue. General revenues, contributions to term and permanent endowments, contributions to permanent fund principal, special and extraordinary items, and transfers should be reported separately after the total net expenses of the government's functions, ultimately arriving at the "change in net position" for the period. At a minimum, the statement of activities should present:
 
 a. Activities accounted for in governmental funds by function to coincide with the level of detail required in the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances
 
 b. Activities accounted for in enterprise funds by different identifiable activities.</link:label>

Expendable assets are assigned to the various governmental funds according to the purposes for which they may or must be used; current liabilities are assigned to the fund from which they are to be paid; and the difference between governmental fund assets and deferred outflows of resources, and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, the fund equity, is referred to as "Fund Balance."</link:label>
